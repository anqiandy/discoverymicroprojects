    "A chess game occurs between two players: one player who plays with the **white chess pieces** and a second player who plays with the **black chess pieces**.  Each player has a skill rating, called their \"Elo rating\", that measures their skill at the game of chess.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The columns `WhiteElo` and `BlackElo` contain data about the ratings of each player before the game begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chess match will always result in either the white pieces winning (represented by `1-0`, meaning that \"white scored one point\"), the black pieces winning (represented by `0-1`, meaning \"black scored one point\"), or a draw where neither player wins (represented by `1/2-1/2`, meaning both players scored a half-point).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The column `Result` contains either `1-0`, `0-1`, or `1/2-1/2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a game of chess does not last forever, every chess match is played with a \"time control\".  The time control indicates the total number of seconds each player has for the entire game and how many additional seconds each player gets for each move played.  If a player runs out of time, they forfeit the game due to running out of time (called a `\"Time forfeit\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The column `TimeControl` indicates the time control for the game.  A time control of `60+1` indicates each player has **60 seconds** to play the entire game with an additional **1 second** for each moved played.\n",
    "- The column `Termination` contains `\"Normal\"` for a normal game ending, or `\"Time forfeit\"` if a player runs out of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the first several moves of a chess game determines the overall \"structure\" of the game in high-level chess.  Each common sequence of initial moves are given a name (ex: \"Queen's Gambit\", \"Scandinavian Defense\", \"Caro-Kann Defense\", etc).  The opening used in each game and the three character code from [Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopaedia_of_Chess_Openings) for the opening is provided as part of this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The column `Opening` contains the opening name.\n",
    "- The column `ECO` contains the [Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopaedia_of_Chess_Openings) code for the opening."
