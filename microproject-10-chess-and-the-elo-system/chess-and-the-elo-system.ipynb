    "\n",
    "- The column `Result` contains either `1-0`, `0-1`, or `1/2-1/2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a game of chess does not last forever, every chess match is played with a \"time control\".  The time control indicates the total number of seconds each player has for the entire game and how many additional seconds each player gets for each move played.  If a player runs out of time, they forfeit the game due to running out of time (called a `\"Time forfeit\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The column `TimeControl` indicates the time control for the game.  A time control of `60+1` indicates each player has **60 seconds** to play the entire game with an additional **1 second** for each moved played.\n",
    "- The column `Termination` contains `\"Normal\"` for a normal game ending, or `\"Time forfeit\"` if a player runs out of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the first several moves of a chess game determines the overall \"structure\" of the game in high-level chess.  Each common sequence of initial moves are given a name (ex: \"Queen's Gambit\", \"Scandinavian Defense\", \"Caro-Kann Defense\", etc).  The opening used in each game and the three character code from [Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopaedia_of_Chess_Openings) for the opening is provided as part of this dataset.\n",
